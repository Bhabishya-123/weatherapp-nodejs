# weatherapp-nodejs
I have created weather app that fetch data from api and dynamically show its data in websites using Nodejs.

# what you need to use
You have to use EJS(like: HTML) , CSS and small piece of nodejs code to make this small weather-api-apps.
Generally, here we are just fetching globally available data from other sites by using api.

# Level
Basic
It is very simple and important projects of nodejs api.
So you can add this app in your resume as well.
