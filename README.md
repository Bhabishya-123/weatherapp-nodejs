# weatherapp-nodejs
I have created weather app that fetch data from api and dynamically show its data in websites using Nodejs.

# what you need to use
You have to use EJS(like: HTML) , CSS and small piece of nodejs code to make this small weather-api-apps.
Generally, here we are just fetching globally available data from other sites by using api.

# Level
Basic
It is very simple and important projects of nodejs api.
So you can add this app in your resume as well.

# How to use this code on your projects
You can simply download every files from github and after that you have to install npm and have to download all the dependencies listed in package.json file
Why i need to download further stuffs?
ans= because nodemodules folder can't be uploaded in github and as you know it stores all the dependencies inside .
